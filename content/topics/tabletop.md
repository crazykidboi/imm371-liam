The magic mirror introduced us to a number of usable technology stacks, and got us thinking about passive user interaction.
The tabletop interaction is not about the technology stack. This is provided for you (top-down projector). This prototype is about developing a comprehensive way to think about augmenting interactions, and a way to design user experiences for serious play.
