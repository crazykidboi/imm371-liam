Create an instillation that supports, enforces, facilitates, and allows play in a user-chosen activity, while still facilitating the environments' other (original) objectives. 

The prompt here is pretty abstract. Lets' break it down. First consider a few different kinds of environments that support activities.

### Highly Single-Use
- My office, designed for computer work. Not ideal for meetings.
- Fields, Courts; most spaces-where-sports-happen. 
- Photography Darkroom
- A Walk-in Closet

### Switching Multi-use
- A community stage
- The IMM studio
- Squash/Racketball court
- Dining Rooms (eating, board games, studying)

### Concurrently Multi-use
- A kitchen for filming a cooking show
- An interview space where others can observe, unseen
- A playground

Now consider different categories of intervention: add, remove, encourage, discourage, and alter.

- **Add**. Add a new activity to an environment. *Also a game for people socialize over at a bus stop.*
- **Remove**. Prevent or stop the environments activity. *Install a Bike-share at the bus stop.*
- **Encourage**. Support, multiply, encourage an environments spaces. *Make a Bus stop more comfortable, entertaining.*
- **Discourage**. Decrease or deemphasize the environments activity. *Design so you do less waiting at a bus stop.*
- **Alter**. Change the intended activity to something else. *Hack the bus stop to turn it into a sidewalk art gallery.*
