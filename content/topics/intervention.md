Design an installation that supports, enforces, facilitates, and allows play in a user-chosen activity, while still facilitating the environments' other (original) objectives.

This is a first pass, of sorts, at the workflow and execution of the final project, where a complete round of ideation and feedback can be academically tackled and before dealing with implementation.
