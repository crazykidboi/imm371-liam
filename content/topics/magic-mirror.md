For this project, students will make passive interactive visualizations that invite viewers to play.

The 'mirror' will reinterpret and reflect some representation of the user back at them. It will show them a version of themself.

> "Magic Mirror" is, in my opinion, a very boring topic. It's been done. It's been done a lot. My initial concept when preparing this course was to make sure we avoided it all all costs.
> I want to challenge students to go beyond it. I realized that if we did not confront the magic mirror, it would be a trap. So instead, we are leaning in.
> If we do make magic mirrors, how can we make them interesting? Exciting? Original?
>
> They also make for good introductory projects to learning the tools.
