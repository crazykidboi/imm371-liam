title: Exploring Play, Gamification, and Design Methods
short: Exploration
weeks: 3
topic: 1
---


We will explore methodologies of play, gamification, and design methods that will inform the processes of all of the later IMM projects in Studio III: Serious Play.

Students will complete a series of small play reflections, do some introductory user-research on learning and play, and visit a museum.

In reflecting on their visit site, studentâ€™s will use all of their reflective research to pitch an immersive experience/interaction that uses elements of play and has the goal of conveying something meant to be learned.
