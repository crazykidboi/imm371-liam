topic: 1
---

For this project students will explore methodologies of play, gamification, and design methods that will inform the processes of all of the later IMM projects in Studio III: Serious Play.

Students will complete a series of small play reflections, do some introductory user-research on learning and play, and visit a museum.

In reflecting on their visit site, student’s will use all of their reflective research to pitch an immersive experience/interaction that uses elements of play and has the goal of conveying something meant to be learned.
