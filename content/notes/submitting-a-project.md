### Overview
This website is hosted on github. It's content is generated from Markdown files into a static HTML website that is served by Github Pages. It uses Hugo to do the conversion from markdown files to html.

When I push changes to the markdown (plain text) files, github will automatically regenerate the html files, using a template I wrote, running some scripts (ie: hugo) that are defined in a feature called Github Actions.

This means that all we need to do to update the website is add a markdown file to the github repository (and then wait a few minutes). We don't need to do anything with any HTML files directly.

### Submitting Your Project
To submit your project, we will use the following workflow:

1. Create a 'fork' of the original repository that you have access to and the ability to edit.
2. Add your folder and files with the appropriate formatting, styling, etc.
3. Create a "Pull Request" asking me to merge the changes you have made on your copy of the website to my original repository.
4. I will approve (or not), and the changes will be merged in.
5. Done.
