title: Notes on Environment Intervention
---
Consider a few different kinds of environments that support activities.

### Highly Single-Use
- My office, designed for computer work. Not ideal for meetings.
- Fields, Courts; most spaces-where-sports-happen. 
- Photography Darkroom
- A Walk-in Closet

### Switching Multi-use
- A community stage
- The IMM studio
- Squash/Racketball court
- Dining Rooms (eating, board games, studying)

### Concurrently Multi-use
- A kitchen for filming a cooking show
- An interview space where others can observe, unseen
- A playground
- Coffee Shops for (working, socializing, etc) and enjoying coffee

Now consider different categories of intervention: add, remove, encourage, discourage, and alter.

- **Add**. Add a new activity to an environment. *Also a game for people socialize over at a bus stop.*
- **Remove**. Prevent or stop the environments activity. *Install a Bike-share at a bus stop.*
- **Encourage**. Support, multiply, encourage an environments spaces. *Make a Bus stop more comfortable, entertaining. (Support the act of 'waiting')*
- **Discourage**. Decrease or deemphasize the environments activity. *Provide up-to-date bus time information (Create less need for waiting at a bus stop)*
- **Alter**. Change the intended activity to something else. *Turn the bus stop into a sidewalk art gallery.*
