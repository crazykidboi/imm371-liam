## Why Magic Mirrors?

"Magic Mirror" projects have historically been, my opinion, boring. When preparing this course, I interrogated my own unenthusiastic reaction to these experiences, and came to the conclusion that they aren't inherently boring. Rather, I just find them disappointing. A mix of technical and conceptual simplicity that leaves me feeling... nothing.

For this project, the technical simplicity is a good thing! It's makes this an excellent introductory project to these kinds of experiences. 

As for the conceptual simplicity... If we did not confront the magic mirror, it would become a trap for students. The trap of magic mirrors - to rely on the playfulness of a mirror to do the heavy lifting, instead of embedding or bringing 'new' meaning to the interaction - is a trap we can find in a lot of interactive exhibit, and serious play, projects. 

So let's all interrogate these projects together. Don't just try to surprise me, try to surprise yourself. The structure here is loose: I invite students to challenge the boundaries of what a 'magic mirror' even is.
