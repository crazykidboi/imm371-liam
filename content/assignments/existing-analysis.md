Find and experience a tiltFive or approved AR experience. Take notes on design and execution decisions made while playing.

During class, we will have created a survey of questions to ask about existing projects. Your assignment is two parts:

1. Fill out the survey about this experience.
2. Capture and submit your notes. They can be informal.
