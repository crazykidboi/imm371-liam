In class, we will brainstorm and assess research questions about play, games, and ways in which people like to learn.
Then students create a microsoft form, polleverywhere, or other agreed upon format to collect this data.

Each person is to get at least 10 people (Not students who are in this class) to respond to the research questions.

Prepare to present this data to the class.

5-10 responses due at the beginning of class for discussion.
Completion of the research and analysis is due with the final project presentation on.

- After the in class question generation session and review, students are expected to refine their questions based on instructor feedback and start their research.
- Students are expected to use fill-in-the-box style collections to collect demographic data to pair with their specific research questions. This is to include age, race, gender, and
class information.
