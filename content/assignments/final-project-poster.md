## Poster Document
The Poster Document is, effectively, a version of your project documentation that is printable on a 1-page pdf.

*We plan on printing these and putting them up in the space in the future*.

The poster is for future students to understand what you made after the project has been torn down, and you should aim to document/write with that audience in mind - while sticking to present tense.

- At least one strong image. The documentation imagery should be explanatory while letting you show off your work, and you are invited to caputre images during the showcase day for this purpose.
- Include a brief description/explanation, but don't get into the details on how it works.
- Include names of everyone who worked on the project.
- Include the semester.
- The poster should "survive" as a one-pager. If you print additional pages, they may not be included - a good spot for supplamental imagery.
