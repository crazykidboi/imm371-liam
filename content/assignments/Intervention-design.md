title: Environment Intervention Design Document
---
Create a two-page document that designs an installation. The space you choose must be a real space on campus, but the design need not be technicall (logistically, financially, beuarocratically) pheasable. You are conducting interviews and creating a design document.

## Process
1. First, read [Notes on Environment Intervention]({{< ref "../notes/intervention-notes.md" >}})
1. Come up with the context for your intervention: space, relationships, activities, technologies.
1. Conduct an interview with at least one relevant user of the space/activity and take interview notes (this will be submitted). This interview can be with a user, or with someone who manages the space. *(Note: Immersive Media faculty may not be interviewed about the Immersive Media space. Too easy.)*
1. Prepare your **Design Document**.

## Design Document Formal Requirements

Normally our documents are either pitch documents (outside audiences) or internal design documents (internal, used for reference). This is a little bit of both, like you are in a room with a client, and the client brought the implementation team (architects? engineers?) to the meeting with them.

##### Formal Requirements
- Student/assignment/meta information
- Title, space, location
- A sketch or visual representation of your intervention
- No more than two pages in .pdf format
- Reasonable formatting
- Clear and concise writing. Objective sections are free from opinions, posturing, and hypothetical
- Uploaded to brightspace and a printed copy (single sided) brought into class.

##### Written objetives:
- (Core) The [Problem Definition]({{< ref "../notes/problem-definition.md" >}}).
- (Objective) A description of the experience. Include the activity in question, how it works without the intervention, how the intervention intervenes, the intended outcomes, and anything else one would need to know to understand the user experience.
- (Subjective) Take a short paragraph to sell me (a potential client, a user, a manufacturer) on it. Why is this intervention good? Fun? Interesting? Exciting? Popular? Wanted? Attractive? Aesthetic? What gives it the special sauce? Why should anyone care at all?
