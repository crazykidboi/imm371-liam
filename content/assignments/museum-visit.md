Visit a museum and write a reflection.

Visit one of the many museums in Pittsburgh and reflect on the experience in the way you have with the play responses above.

Spend half of your reflection on the overall experience and the other half on a single experience, exhibit, or moment from your visit.

This can be a place you have visited before, but I would encourage you to visit somewhere new.

This must be a trip done after the first day of class.

1-2 pages and include at least 3-4 pictures of your trip & subject
