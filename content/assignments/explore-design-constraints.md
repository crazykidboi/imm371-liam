title: Explore Design Constraints Prototype
order: 6

1.	Read [Tilt Five Design Tips and Guidelines](https://docs.tiltfive.com/t5_design_considerations.html).

In class, we will explore the technology and collaboratively create a list of various design constraints. Choose one, from this list or not.

Each student will choose a design constraint, and then create a single demonstrative/explorative sketch that fulfulls the following goals:

1. Gives the creator of the sketch insight into the design space
2. Effectively communicates the space to others.
3. Provides insight for making a design decision about this space.

For example, if we were looking at fine repetitive textures, perhaps there is a room full of objects of varying textures and texture resolutions that look better/worse, laid out along a spectrum.
There is clear A/B comparison. Further, one would be able to understand how they might choose certain texture densities going forward.

 > See the rubric with the assignment on brightspace for further clarification of project expectations.

### Some Possible Constraints
- Anti-aliasing
- Bright primary colors
- Repetitive patterns and moire
- Height/Depth
- Well effect and parallax
- Range of head motion
- Laser pointer accuracy vs. position/height

### Rubric
An up-to-date rubric is viewable with the assignment on brightspace.
