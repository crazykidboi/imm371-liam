Respond in writing to the games we played in class.

Think about the process of learning the rules, the experience of doing it with others, elements you liked and didnâ€™t like (and why), what aspects were fun, what aspects were engaging, what was
confusing.

Take a fine grained comb to the experience and try to think about the moment to moment experience of the game and what it felt like and what it felt like to do this overall.

Think about the design of the game and who you think the intended audience is.

Make lists of elements, but also try to write out some of this in the format of prose, too.

1-2 pages.
