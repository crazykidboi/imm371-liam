### Notes
- Must be in the library, with librarian approval, without particular and given exception
- Any technology is 'fair game', but along with that, any technology or process can be veto'd by the professor
- Installations that can live 24/7, or on their own timer/diurnal cycles, are heavily encouraged.
- Students will be responsible for maintencne and upkeep of the installation through a certain start/end date (TBD)
