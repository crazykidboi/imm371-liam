title: Research Question Prototype
order: 2
---

This project revisits the sketches, except the purpose is exploration of the hardware.

While sketches are explorations of ideas, this project refines that into an exploration of capabilities.

Create 1-3 sketches for the system, with a unique goal. Have a single hardware/technical question in your mind, and explore it until you are satisfied you will be able to present some insight.

Title the project with the constraint/question you are exploring, and take screenshots or video capture.

## Questions
-	How does MixCast work? What are it's limitations?
-	Does Video playback work in the tilt five?
-	How hard is it to track multiple wands?
-	Can we use multiple wands with one headset? More than two?

-	Can we show unique views or secret information to different headsets?
-	How small can we effectively render?
