My Magic Mirror is a infinitely echoing down in scale heptagon that reacts to the userâ€™s voice to create adaptive hue changes, wiggle physics changes, and audio echos that play back to them in real time. The user approaches the mic in front of a projection of the infinite shapes, they are reflected back within the pattern both visually and audibly.
